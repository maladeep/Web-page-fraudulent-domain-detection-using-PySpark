# Web-page-fraudulent-domain-detection-using-PySpark


Phishing remains a highly successful and efficient method for cybercriminals to deceive individuals and extract their personal and financial data. The increasing dependence on the internet for our daily activities has created an ideal platform for cybercriminals to execute well-targeted phishing schemes. Modern phishing attacks are intricate and harder to detect. This project exclusively uses PySpark for analyzing URLs and finding the best model for classifying them.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/web-page-phishing-detection-dataset.


# Getting Started

To get started with this project and explore the EDA along with PySpark notebooks, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
* Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to explore the EDA.


The next notebook, Pyspark ML for fraudulent domain detection, contains machine learning modeling for web page classification. It builds upon the insights gained during the EDA phase to develop and evaluate machine learning models for phishing detection.
